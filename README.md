  - `exponents.csv`: Contains the original data for exponents.
  - `exponents_table.csv`: Contains the final table that can be included in the paper.

### 2. Velocity Metric

All information related to the velocity metric can be found in the `velocity_metric` folder. This folder contains the following sections:

- **Sheets** (located in `velocity_metric/sheets`):
  - `velocities.csv`: Contains the original data for the velocity metric.
  - `filtered_velocities.csv`: Contains the filtered data for the velocity metric.
  - `filtered_velocities_table.csv`: Contains the final table for the filtered data that can be included in the paper.
  - `velocities_table.csv`: Contains the final table for the original data that can be included in the paper.
  - `terrain_entropies.xlsx`: Contains the calculated entropies for the different terrains, which can be used in case GSN is going to be brought back.

- **Graphs**:
  - **Filtered**: Contains graphs generated from data that was filtered to exclude exponents. These graphs are located in the `velocity_metric/graphs/filtered` folder.
  - **All**: Contains graphs generated from unfiltered data. These graphs are located in the `velocity_metric/graphs/all` folder.

### 3. Filtering Script

The filtering process for the velocity metric data was performed using the script located at `velocity_metric/filter.py`.
